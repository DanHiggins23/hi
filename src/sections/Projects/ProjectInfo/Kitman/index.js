          description="During my time at Kitman, I've worked on multiple projects with high profile clients, such as Premier League and NFL, and been fully involved in the full lifecycle of a feature, from concept to roll-out. Daily, I build features using a tech stack of React, FLowJS, RTK, RTL & Jest, along with MUI. I play an Integral role in key initiatives including integrating
playwright into our workflow, converting our architecture
over to SPA, and implementing analytical tools such as
Mixpanel and Google Tag Manager. I've really been enjoying the more leadership role I've taken here, where I take ownership of major epics, and also review CVâ€™s, interview candidates, buddy-ing new
starters and mentoring colleagues. Additionally, after achieving my Professional Scrum Master I certification, I also took on the responsibility of Scrum master within the squad, facilitating ceremonies,
and constantly adapting and implementing changes to
increase story point output, whilst becoming more
accurate on estimations and reducing pain points."

I really got into the weeds with the full archetecture of the system, and would consider myself a key knowledge asset in many key aspects of the application."
